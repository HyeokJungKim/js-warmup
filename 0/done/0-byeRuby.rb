##### will invoking a method before it's declared work?
# hello_world

# def hello_world
#     puts "hello from Ruby"
# end


#### this is how we declare variables in Ruby
# language = "Ruby"

#### what happens if you store a method to an object?
# object = {
#     a: "a",
#     b: "b",
#     function: hello_world
# }

# object
